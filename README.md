# NAND-2-Tetris

> Building a Modern Computer from First Principles

[Coursera - Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

This repository contains my implementation of all the tasks from the nand2tetris course on Coursera. It includes all the source codes, ranging from low-level CPU gates programmed in HDL to high-level language compilers and operating systems.

## Directory Structure

Original structure from the course follows the pattern `project/NN`, when `NN` stands for the week number. **This repository uses a structure decoupled from weeks, but coupled to functionality**.

* `spec`
  * `asm` --> `project/06`
  * `cpu` --> `project/04`
